For the city of Grand Island, this was likely the overall-worst wind storm in several years, as the airport ASOS clocked a peak gust of 87 MPH. Countless trees/large branches were blown down within the city, along with several power lines, and there was also some (mainly) minor structural damage. Grand Island Emergency Center logged nearly 300 storm related incidents, including traffic hazards, power outages, alarms and fire concerns from sparking electricity. The storm also caused an (indirect) traffic fatality in rural Hall County southeast of Cairo, when a man crashed his pickup into a large, downed tree arched across a paved county road. To the south in Hastings, damage was less-severe overall, as the ASOS peak gust on the west side of town was only 70 MPH. However, stronger winds likely impacted areas just east of the city, as large trees were uprooted at Central Community College and several rail cars were reportedly blown over at a repair facility near the Clay County line. Several smaller communities also reported notable wind damage, including: Cairo, Alda, Wood River, Doniphan, Glenvil, and Fairfield. West of Clay Center, fairly extensive damage occurred on the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center campus, including broken windows and roof damage to several buildings. In addition to the aforementioned peak wind gusts at Grand Island/Hastings airports, some of the more notable unofficial (mesonet) gusts included: 85 MPH near Fairfield, 80 MPH near Alda and Wood River, 79 MPH in Doniphan and 73 MPH near Nelson. Despite the multitude of damaging wind reports, hail reports were quite scarce, as the vast majority of stones were likely dime size or smaller. Rainfall-wise, a fairly widespread coverage of 2-3 soaked several northern counties including: Valley, Greeley, Sherman, Nance and Merrick. Although resultant flooding was not very extensive in most of the area, the Mira Creek in southern Valley County breached its banks for the second time in five days, again prompting minor flooding on the north side of North Loup that continued into the early morning of the 8th.||Breaking down the timing and meteorological background of this event, it's worth noting that these South Central Nebraska damaging winds were actually the finale to a much longer swath of severe weather that initiated in southern ND and north central SD during the afternoon/evening of the 6th. Between 1-2 a.m. CDT on the 7th, the leading edge of this narrow-but-potent mesoscale convective system (MCS) entered far northern portions of the local area into Valley/Greeley counties, signaling its arrival with a 59 MPH gust at Ord airport. However, the worst was yet to come, as during the next few hours the storm complex morphed into more of an outflow-dominant, high-precipitation supercell, slamming through the Grand Island/Hastings areas between 2:30-3:30 a.m. CDT before eventually exiting Nuckolls/Thayer counties into Kansas by 5 a.m. CDT. In the wake of the main show, a few weaker clusters of storms redeveloped over parts of the area into the daylight hours, but were of little significance. In the big picture of the mid-upper levels, this event occurred within a fairly classic summertime northwest-flow regime, as the Central Plains resided northeast of an expansive ridge centered over New Mexico. At the surface, South Central Nebraska was on the backside of a weak ridge axis centered near the Nebraska-Iowa border. This promoted light-but-steady, south-southeast breezes in advance of the approaching storm complex, with surface dewpoints averaging mid-upper 60s F. Although there were question marks about how far southward into Nebraska the potential severe weather threat would extend, the combination of seasonably-stout flow aloft (deep-layer wind shear of at least 40-60 knots) and sufficient instability (mixed-layer CAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg) was clearly supportive of an intense late-night storm. Also enhancing the severe weather environment was a modest, 30 knot  southwesterly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) and its associated low-level warm air/moisture advection.","A 69 MPH wind gust was measured by a mesonet station located 1 mile south of Cairo. Wind gusts estimated to be at least 60 MPH were reported in Cairo. Approximately three miles south-southeast of Cairo, near the intersection of Airport Road and Burwick Road, a motorist struck a large tree that had been blown down and died from his injuries.",CSV

As for hail, the largest reported stones up to golf ball size occurred in McCool Junction and southeast of Sutton. Severe-criteria wind reports were quite limited, but a mesonet southwest of Nelson gusted to 64 MPH and a completely separate batch of storms farther west yielded a 63 MPH mesonet gust near Cambridge. The most impactful flooding report involved a multiple-hour closure of Highway 136 in far western Nuckolls County due to water over the road.

Then between 10 p.m. and midnight CDT and slightly to the southwest of the initial storms, additional severe convection and flooding rains blossomed over Nuckolls and eastern Webster counties. After midnight, the most intense storms gradually weakened and/or slipped south of the state line into Kansas, although weaker activity lingered a few more hours before ending altogether. Completely separate from (and several counties to the west of) the severe convection in southeastern counties, a small cluster of storms entered Furnas County from the west shortly before midnight CDT, generating the aforementioned severe gust near Cambridge before quickly weakening. Turning to the meteorological setup, a broad quasi-zonal flow regime was present in the mid-upper levels, featuring passing low-amplitude disturbances. At the surface, the initial evening development seemed to concentrate along a subtle, west-east front, in a mesoscale environment featuring a relatively potent combination of 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and around 30 knots of deep-layer wind shear.

The culprits were two separate linear mesoscale convective systems (MCS), with the first one by far the most impactful. This first storm complex, which traversed the area between 10:30 p.m. and 3 a.m. CDT, produced a swath of damaging winds ranging anywhere from 60 up to around 90 MPH, particularly within a corridor centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from Cambridge-Minden-Hastings-Sutton. Within this area, there were countless reports of damage, particularly to the likes of trees (many large trees uprooted), power poles/lines and irrigation pivots, but also to some structures (mainly rural outbuildings). A short list of some of the hardest-hit communities included: Arapahoe, Oxford, Kenesaw and Hastings, with Hastings likely enduring its most widespread tree damage in roughly five years. As just a few specific instances of damage and/or measured winds: a grain bin and outbuilding were destroyed near Holbrook with irrigation pipe blown up to one-half mile; an unofficial mesonet gusted to 95 MPH near Oxford; several farm outbuildings were damaged/destroyed near Phillips with sheet metal hanging in trees. Within the Tri Cities, Hastings clearly bore the brunt of wind issues, as Grand Island and Kearney only received a glancing blow of sub-severe gusts mainly in the 40-55 MPH range. However, some places outside of the main damage swath still weren't spared from storm impacts, including in Farwell, where a lightning-induced fire damaged a portion of the fire hall. This primary linear MCS exhibited impressive radar signatures including a bookend vortex and rear inflow notch, with the system as a whole taking on a notable S-shape on reflectivity. As the initial MCS began departing the local area into eastern Nebraska, a second round of storms got underway back to the west, in response to lift above the residual cold pool. Although not nearly as intense/organized as the earlier system, this convection congealed into a northeast-southwest oriented MCS as it entered southwestern counties such as Furnas/Gosper/Harlan between 3:30-4:30 a.m. CDT. For a while, this second system remained slightly sub-severe, with peak gusts only to around 50 MPH (including 53 MPH at Hastings airport). However, some intensification to marginally-severe levels occurred between 5:30-6:30 a.m. CDT in far southeast counties, evidenced by mesonet wind gusts of 67 MPH near Superior and 60 MPH at Davenport. The back edge of this second MCS departed the local area out of Thayer County by 7 a.m. CDT, finally ending the rocky night. ||Interestingly, severe-criteria hail was very limited during this event, taking a clear backseat to damaging winds. However, a few quarter size stones were reported in and near communities such as Cambridge and Nelson. The Cambridge area was likely the hardest-hit, as copious amounts of mainly small hail combined with winds to promote fairly extensive crop damage. Rainfall-wise, the majority of South Central Nebraska measured between 0.50-1.50, holding flooding issues at bay. However, there were limited corridors of 2-3+, particularly within parts of Furnas/Gosper/Phelps counties. Including more rain that fell on the morning of the 22nd, Thayer County actually dealt with some of the worst flooding issues in the ensuing few days, such as water over several rural roads and a bridge washout north of Chester. ||Looking at the meteorological setup, this was a fairly classic recipe for intense overnight convection in the Central Plains. In the mid-upper levels, seasonably-strong, west-southwesterly flow was in place, downstream from a large-scale trough centered over the Northern Rockies. At the surface, South Central Nebraska resided just north of a west-east oriented front stretched near the Kansas border. As a low-amplitude disturbance entered southern Nebraska during the evening, this forcing combined with a very unstable airmass and increasing moisture convergence within the exit region of a 30-40 knot southerly low level jet to spark the MCS activity. By late-night standards, it was a fairly volatile mesoscale environment, featuring 2000-4000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and 30-40 knots of deep-layer wind shear.","Wind gusts estimated to be near 70 MPH caused damage approximately 3 miles northeast of Upland.

Meanwhile, a strong lake breeze shielded the Niagara Frontier. A solid line of strong convection over southern Ontario approached the western edge of the lake breeze late in the afternoon. It was initially believed that the line would weaken as it tried to cross into the marine stabilized air. While the convection itself did weaken, a strong outflow pushed southeast across Niagara county. A warning was in place for the strong winds, and strong gusts did materialize in Niagara Falls. Additional cells formed in the still very unstable air mass over the Southern Tier while the southern Ontario convection broke down. As the evening wore on, the outflow from the southern Ontario convection merged with the eastern edge of the old lake breeze boundary, and a new line blew up east of Batavia and Warsaw. This line eventually supported warnings for the remainder of the area.",Trees were reported down.,CSV

Quite simply, this was a nasty wind storm, packing a punch with gusts ranging from around 60 to nearly 90 MPH along and several miles either side of a line stretching from Ord-Grand Island-Hastings-Hardy. For the city of Grand Island, this was likely the overall-worst wind storm in several years, as the airport ASOS clocked a peak gust of 87 MPH. Countless trees/large branches were blown down within the city, along with several power lines, and there was also some (mainly) minor structural damage. Grand Island Emergency Center logged nearly 300 storm related incidents, including traffic hazards, power outages, alarms and fire concerns from sparking electricity. The storm also caused an (indirect) traffic fatality in rural Hall County southeast of Cairo, when a man crashed his pickup into a large, downed tree arched across a paved county road. To the south in Hastings, damage was less-severe overall, as the ASOS peak gust on the west side of town was only 70 MPH. However, stronger winds likely impacted areas just east of the city, as large trees were uprooted at Central Community College and several rail cars were reportedly blown over at a repair facility near the Clay County line. Several smaller communities also reported notable wind damage, including: Cairo, Alda, Wood River, Doniphan, Glenvil, and Fairfield. West of Clay Center, fairly extensive damage occurred on the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center campus, including broken windows and roof damage to several buildings. In addition to the aforementioned peak wind gusts at Grand Island/Hastings airports, some of the more notable unofficial (mesonet) gusts included: 85 MPH near Fairfield, 80 MPH near Alda and Wood River, 79 MPH in Doniphan and 73 MPH near Nelson. Despite the multitude of damaging wind reports, hail reports were quite scarce, as the vast majority of stones were likely dime size or smaller. Rainfall-wise, a fairly widespread coverage of 2-3 soaked several northern counties including: Valley, Greeley, Sherman, Nance and Merrick. Although resultant flooding was not very extensive in most of the area, the Mira Creek in southern Valley County breached its banks for the second time in five days, again prompting minor flooding on the north side of North Loup that continued into the early morning of the 8th.||Breaking down the timing and meteorological background of this event, it's worth noting that these South Central Nebraska damaging winds were actually the finale to a much longer swath of severe weather that initiated in southern ND and north central SD during the afternoon/evening of the 6th. Between 1-2 a.m. CDT on the 7th, the leading edge of this narrow-but-potent mesoscale convective system (MCS) entered far northern portions of the local area into Valley/Greeley counties, signaling its arrival with a 59 MPH gust at Ord airport. However, the worst was yet to come, as during the next few hours the storm complex morphed into more of an outflow-dominant, high-precipitation supercell, slamming through the Grand Island/Hastings areas between 2:30-3:30 a.m. CDT before eventually exiting Nuckolls/Thayer counties into Kansas by 5 a.m. CDT. In the wake of the main show, a few weaker clusters of storms redeveloped over parts of the area into the daylight hours, but were of little significance. In the big picture of the mid-upper levels, this event occurred within a fairly classic summertime northwest-flow regime, as the Central Plains resided northeast of an expansive ridge centered over New Mexico. At the surface, South Central Nebraska was on the backside of a weak ridge axis centered near the Nebraska-Iowa border. This promoted light-but-steady, south-southeast breezes in advance of the approaching storm complex, with surface dewpoints averaging mid-upper 60s F. Although there were question marks about how far southward into Nebraska the potential severe weather threat would extend, the combination of seasonably-stout flow aloft (deep-layer wind shear of at least 40-60 knots) and sufficient instability (mixed-layer CAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg) was clearly supportive of an intense late-night storm. Also enhancing the severe weather environment was a modest, 30 knot  southwesterly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) and its associated low-level warm air/moisture advection.","A 75 MPH wind gust was measured by the Central Nebraska Regional Airport ASOS at 2:49 AM CDT, and an 87 MPH wind gust was measured at 2:51 AM CDT. Widespread tree damage occurred all around the Grand Island area, some trees were totally uprooted and large limbs were downed. Extensive tree damage occurred at the Stuhr Museum on the south side of town. Damage to power lines, power poles, roofs and sheds was also reported.

The predominant weather revolved around damaging winds and heavy rainfall, though a few instances of severe hail and low end tornadoes were experienced as well. Among the reports, numerous trees were downed, buildings damaged or destroyed from straight line winds or one of the weak tornadoes, and numerous instances of 2 to 4 plus inches of heavy rainfall. ||On the setup side of the coin, a lot of factors were in line for the event to potentially be a sustained nocturnal severe weather event. The previous day, the 19th, saw surface high pressure begin to exit the region eastward and allowing southerly return flow to work into eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. Tied in with mid to upper 70 dew points and steep mid-level lapse rates, a large area of 4000 plus J/kg CAPE values developed across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa and slowly built eastward. Additionally, effect bulk shear was consistently in the 40 to 50 kt range and low level shear roughly oriented to expected storm motion. As the evening progressed and the low level jet finally began to ramp up, boosting warm air advection and positive moisture flux, storms began to develop and eventually congeal. Organization, at least with regards to strong to severe criteria, was not immediate, waiting until around 5am local time to produce its first severe report.

Widely scattered thunderstorms began forming around 1 PM CST along and west of Highway 183. By 2 PM CST, a persistent line segment of thunderstorms began affecting western Dawson county. Over the following four hours, this southwest-northeast oriented line slowly crept east across Dawson county into western Buffalo county, with its southwest end moving from Gosper county into Phelps county. A downburst occurred in Cozad where winds were measured at 63 mph. Further east, trees were damaged near Elm Creek. This line of storms subsequently weakened as it moved into eastern Buffalo county. However, between 5 and 9 PM CST, numerous small thunderstorms formed over Gosper, Furnas, Phelps, and Harlan counties. Storms kept forming over these counties until a multi-county area of persistent heavy rain enveloped these counties and expanded north to include Dawson and Buffalo counties. By 9 PM CST, the heaviest rain had morphed to the southeast side of a large, expanding rain shield, with a nearly stationary band stretching from southwest to northeast across Furnas, Phelps, and Buffalo counties. After 10 PM CST, a large squall line that had developed far to the west, over the high plains, began moving into south-central Nebraska. It brought a third period of heavy rain to these counties, but its cold pool aided in shoving the training, slow-moving mass of heavy rain eastward. The two areas of rain merged with a progressive squall line subsequently advancing across the rest of the south central Nebraska. The squall line exited into southeast Nebraska by 230 AM CST. Severe downburst winds occurred a few spots with this squall line. A few tree limbs were snapped off in Oxford and Kearney, and 36 power poles were snapped off over a 2-mile stretch southeast of Holdrege. The highest rainfall total reported was 10.65 inches 3 miles southwest of Odessa. The second highest was 8.88 inches in Loomis. 8.33 fell near Hildreth, 7.66 in Riverdale, 7.60 near Lexington, 6.50 near Cozad, 5.90 near Minden, and 5.64 on the southwest side of Kearney.||Late in the afternoon, a few thunderstorms moved north from Kansas ahead of the storms west of Highway 183. These storms produced some spotty tree damage in Webster and Kearney counties, and damage two livestock sheds in the town of Ayr. A brief rope tornado was also reported near Roseland. ||At the surface, a stalled front extended from the Mid-Atlantic states west to the southern Kansas border. Throughout the day, this front gradually lifted north as a warm front. Meanwhile, low pressure over eastern Colorado moved into northwest Kansas, joining the western end of the front. In the upper-levels weak southwest flow was over Nebraska with a longwave trough advancing eastward through the western U.S., and a ridge over the Upper Midwest. An embedded shortwave trough moved out of Colorado and crossed Nebraska, creating a favorable environment for thunderstorms. As the initial thunderstorms developed, the environment was characterized by surface temperatures in the lower to middle 80s, with dewpoints in the lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, but despite that, MLCAPE was 2500-3000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was weak at less than 20 kt. Precipitable water values were around 1.70 inches, which was close to a record. ||The excessive rainfall resulted in flash flooding in parts of Dawson, Gosper, Furnas, Harlan, Phelps, and Buffalo counties, including flooding across parts of U.S. Highways 6, 30, 183, and 283. Numerous gravel county roads were inundated by flood waters and impassible. Many of them were severely damaged. Roads in the city of Kearney were flooded from one curb to the other, and in at least two separate places, water was 3 to 4 ft deep. Almost 40 vehicles were stranded in Kearney streets. Basements were flooded in some homes due to egress windows breaking. The student union was flooded on the University of Nebraska campus in Kearney. Two to three feet of water was reported in the lower level of the food court. In Lexington, cars were stalled in flood waters and 23 people were evacuated from an apartment building due to flooding. The Red Cross opened a shelter to care for those evacuated.||In some areas, the impacts worsened the following day as creeks swelled out of their banks. Gibbon, Kearney, Odessa, Elm Creek, and Lexington were all severely impacted. U.S. highway 30 was closed due to floodwater from Shelton to Kearney to Elm Creek, as well as near Lexington. Turkey Creek drains into the North Channel of the Platte River, which runs through the south side of Kearney. Water rapidly rose on the south side of the city Tuesday morning, inundating numerous hotels, restaurants, businesses, and basements. At least 200 people had to be evacuated from hotels using construction grade front-end loaders. Approximately 100 other nearby residents needed to be evacuated as well. At its peak, water was 2 to 4 feet high inside the hotels, and 4 to 5 feet high in the parking lots. The water rose so quickly that many people staying at the hotels did not have time to move their vehicles. Most vehicles at the hotels were a total loss. Hundreds of vehicles in the city had to be towed. Some businesses were closed for weeks, others for months, as repairs and remodeling were completed. Kitchen equipment was ruined at some restaurants. Of the 1800 hotels rooms in Kearney, only about 600 were available for use because first floor services, such as check-in desks, laundry facilities, and kitchens were damaged. Stagecoach souvenir shop lost 2,000 pounds of merchandise. Second avenue, which is the main north-south thoroughfare through the city, was closed from Interstate 80 to 11th avenue. The Interstate 80 off ramp was also closed. All traffic to and from the Interstate, from the city, had to use the Kearney East Expressway. Approximately 400 Kearney homes were damaged by the flood, and many more beyond city limits. Just as one example, an egress window gave way in a home on the southeast side of Kearney. Water rushed into the basement, filling it nearly to the ceiling. Extensive flooding resulted in the closure of Yanney Park. A power substation flooded and resulted in power outages to about 450 customers. Flood waters began to subside Wednesday, July 10th, which allowed for one lane of 2nd avenue to be reopened in each direction.||In Odessa, flooding was significant. Water was 4 feet deep on Webb street. A little further south, the Odessa exit from Interstate 80 was closed because of significant flooding. Water was about 3 feet deep at the truck stop adjacent to the Interstate. Semi trucks and cars pulled into the truck stop due to the heavy rain Monday evening, but by 630 AM CST Tuesday, water was up to the top of the wheel wells on several semi's. Flooded vehicles had to be towed. The Platte River, which is very wide and shallow, rose 3 feet in 12 hours from 6 PM CST Monday to 6 AM CST Tuesday, and 4 feet in 24 hours. It is very difficult for the Platte River to flood, but it crested at 8.3 feet at 515 PM CST Tuesday. Flood stage is 7 feet.||In the town of Elm Creek, many roads and basements were flooded. A gauge on Elm Creek indicated that the water level rose 8 feet in 2 hours Monday evening.||The city of Lexington issued a disaster declaration due to the disruption of utility services. Streets and homes were flooded with sewers backing up into homes. ||Flooding was extensive along the Wood River. Moderate flooding occurred at Riverdale with water covering the bridge just north of town. Further to the north, flooding forced the closure of state highway 10 between Pleasanton and Hazard.||In Gibbon, water flooded streets and basements for the second time this year. The northeast side of town was impacted the worst with at least 30 homes and several businesses inundated by floodwater. People had to sandbag their homes and businesses. It is believed that flooding on the Wood River was wider with this event, due to changes in the riverbed from the prior flood in March. Some places that did not flood in that event, flooded this time. Many people commented, I can't believe this has happened twice. Several businesses affected by the March flood still remained closed due to damage.||Amtrak trains that travel between Chicago and Emeryville, CA were halted in Lincoln and McCook due to the flooding. There were probably many more impacts that were not documented here as it is not possible to include everything. Widespread flooding of low-lying areas, creeks, and rivers continued for several days following the excessive rain. Flood waters did not recede in some locations until Monday, July 15th. This devastating flood occurred just four months after a catastrophic flood occurred nearby in mid-to-late March. That flood affected areas primarily along and north of the Platte River.",Two livestock sheds sustained minor damage. Report relayed via KSNB Local 4.,CSV

While most of this activity was sub-severe, producing only small hail and/or wind gusts up to around 50 MPH, a notable exception occurred in several southwestern counties where a briefly-supercellular storm produced a flurry of severe-criteria wind gusts primarily between 8-9 p.m. CDT. These severe winds of mainly 60-70 MPH concentrated within northern Furnas, southern Gosper, northwestern Harlan and southern Phelps counties, including an intense (albeit unofficial) gust of 86 MPH clocked by a personal weather station north-northwest of Oxford. While ground-truth damage reports were limited, they included: 1) a power pole blown onto Highway 6/34 in Arapahoe along with several large tree limbs down around town...2) various reports of mainly minor damage in/near Holdrege, including: damaged power poles, a large tree down at the cemetery, and part of an irrigation pivot blown onto a rural road a few miles west of town. As this storm of the day progressed into eastern Phelps County it weakened while transitioning to more of a multicell cluster mode. However, storm intensity occasionally flared up farther east, as evidenced by estimated 55-60 MPH winds in southeast Adams County. Lightning also made the news during the evening, as a bolt from a non-severe storm in Grand Island blew out a roughly 5-by-5 foot section from the roof of a retail store, sparking a small fire. Somewhat surprisingly, there was no verified severe-criteria hail during this event, with the largest reported stones only nickel size.||Timing-wise, the first severe storms of the day in close proximity to (but slightly west of) South Central Nebraska erupted along a well-defined cold front in west-central Nebraska during the mid-afternoon. A few hours later, the first strong storm to affect the local area entered western Dawson County between 6-7 p.m. CDT, followed a bit later by the main, outflow-dominant severe cell that rapidly intensified over Gosper/northern Furnas counties. As the night wore on a few larger-scale, predominantly sub-severe storm complexes traversed much of the 30-county area, with most places eventually rain-free by 4-5 a.m. CDT on the 9th. Meteorologically, this was a fairly strongly-forced event. In the mid-upper levels, west-southwesterly flow was present, slightly downstream from a seasonably-strong, large-scale trough traversing the Northern Rockies. At the surface, the aforementioned, northeast-southwest oriented cold front gradually made its way through South Central Nebraska during the evening and overnight hours. Ahead of this boundary, the mesoscale environment was clearly supportive of severe storms, with early-evening parameters featuring around 2000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 30-40 knots of deep-layer wind shear. As a testament to the strength of the passing cold front, high temperatures across most of South Central Nebraska dropped from the mid-80s F on the 8th to only the upper-60s on the 9th.",Power poles and power lines were damaged in Arapahoe.

Three tornadoes also produced damage, but areal extent of the tornadoes paled in comparison to the damage caused by the downbursts.||During the late morning, and early afternoon of Friday, July 19th, a surface low moved from northeast South Dakota, eastward across central Minnesota, and into west central Wisconsin by the evening.

This contrast produced MLCAPEs of near 5000 J/kg south of the front boundary. Effective wind shear parameters were very strong with values of 50-70 knots across central Minnesota, and into west central Wisconsin by the late afternoon.

The culprits were two separate linear mesoscale convective systems (MCS), with the first one by far the most impactful. This first storm complex, which traversed the area between 10:30 p.m. and 3 a.m. CDT, produced a swath of damaging winds ranging anywhere from 60 up to around 90 MPH, particularly within a corridor centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from Cambridge-Minden-Hastings-Sutton. Within this area, there were countless reports of damage, particularly to the likes of trees (many large trees uprooted), power poles/lines and irrigation pivots, but also to some structures (mainly rural outbuildings). A short list of some of the hardest-hit communities included: Arapahoe, Oxford, Kenesaw and Hastings, with Hastings likely enduring its most widespread tree damage in roughly five years. As just a few specific instances of damage and/or measured winds: a grain bin and outbuilding were destroyed near Holbrook with irrigation pipe blown up to one-half mile; an unofficial mesonet gusted to 95 MPH near Oxford; several farm outbuildings were damaged/destroyed near Phillips with sheet metal hanging in trees. Within the Tri Cities, Hastings clearly bore the brunt of wind issues, as Grand Island and Kearney only received a glancing blow of sub-severe gusts mainly in the 40-55 MPH range. However, some places outside of the main damage swath still weren't spared from storm impacts, including in Farwell, where a lightning-induced fire damaged a portion of the fire hall. This primary linear MCS exhibited impressive radar signatures including a bookend vortex and rear inflow notch, with the system as a whole taking on a notable S-shape on reflectivity. As the initial MCS began departing the local area into eastern Nebraska, a second round of storms got underway back to the west, in response to lift above the residual cold pool. Although not nearly as intense/organized as the earlier system, this convection congealed into a northeast-southwest oriented MCS as it entered southwestern counties such as Furnas/Gosper/Harlan between 3:30-4:30 a.m. CDT. For a while, this second system remained slightly sub-severe, with peak gusts only to around 50 MPH (including 53 MPH at Hastings airport). However, some intensification to marginally-severe levels occurred between 5:30-6:30 a.m. CDT in far southeast counties, evidenced by mesonet wind gusts of 67 MPH near Superior and 60 MPH at Davenport. The back edge of this second MCS departed the local area out of Thayer County by 7 a.m. CDT, finally ending the rocky night. ||Interestingly, severe-criteria hail was very limited during this event, taking a clear backseat to damaging winds. However, a few quarter size stones were reported in and near communities such as Cambridge and Nelson. The Cambridge area was likely the hardest-hit, as copious amounts of mainly small hail combined with winds to promote fairly extensive crop damage. Rainfall-wise, the majority of South Central Nebraska measured between 0.50-1.50, holding flooding issues at bay. However, there were limited corridors of 2-3+, particularly within parts of Furnas/Gosper/Phelps counties. Including more rain that fell on the morning of the 22nd, Thayer County actually dealt with some of the worst flooding issues in the ensuing few days, such as water over several rural roads and a bridge washout north of Chester. ||Looking at the meteorological setup, this was a fairly classic recipe for intense overnight convection in the Central Plains. In the mid-upper levels, seasonably-strong, west-southwesterly flow was in place, downstream from a large-scale trough centered over the Northern Rockies. At the surface, South Central Nebraska resided just north of a west-east oriented front stretched near the Kansas border. As a low-amplitude disturbance entered southern Nebraska during the evening, this forcing combined with a very unstable airmass and increasing moisture convergence within the exit region of a 30-40 knot southerly low level jet to spark the MCS activity. By late-night standards, it was a fairly volatile mesoscale environment, featuring 2000-4000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and 30-40 knots of deep-layer wind shear.",A wind gust of 71 MPH was measured by a home weather station located 4 miles north of Gibbon.,CSV

This setup a strong, meridional flow ahead of this feature. The 925 hPa low level jet of 44 kts was around 4 Standard Deviations above normal, and record for the date per the 12Z/14 TAE sounding. A pre-frontal trough pooled a narrow axis of moisture out ahead of the cold front, and served as a forcing mechanism for convection. Given Bulk Shear (0-6 km) around 60 knots and Surface Based CAPE around 1.2k J/kg, this was more than sufficient for organized, severe thunderstorms. The air mass just ahead of the pre-frontal trough was much drier and capped, initially limiting the development of more discrete cells ahead of the line. In fact, the 12Z/14 TAE sounding sampled a cap of over 5C just below 700 hPa!  However as solar insolation and large scale ascent increased, this cap was broken around 15Z, and the QLCS intensified. The strong wind field and steep low-level lapse rates created an environment favorable for damaging wind gusts, particularly northwest of a line from the Apalachicola River to Tifton GA, where steeper mid-level lapse rates overlayed, leading to greater buoyancy. The tornado threat along the QLCS was dependent on storms becoming more favorably aligned with the Shear Vector (0-3 km), with otherwise sufficient CAPE (0-3 km) and low LCLs. Ahead of the QLCS, the low-level wind field was sheared in the 0-1 km layer, as evidenced on VAD Wind Profiles. As a result, the tornado threat increased with the more discrete cells after the cap broke. The aforementioned strong wind field and steep low-level lapse rates, combined with the isallobaric component of wind, lead to wind gusts around 40 mph well ahead of the QLCS.

A few of the more notable reports included golf ball size hail and a measured 66 MPH gust at Formoso, and half dollar size hail and estimated 65 MPH winds near Webber. To the west of the main storm, the combo of radar signatures and nearby reports from extreme southern Nebraska suggested that hail might have also slipped into far northern Smith and northeastern Phillips counties, but there were no verifying reports. Between 8-9 p.m. CDT the severe weather threat quickly waned within the local area as the most vigorous convection departed off to the east-southeast. Backing up in time, the Jewell County severe storm initiated around 4 p.m. CDT as an isolated, high-precipitation supercell roughly 40 miles north of the state line, gradually acquiring a more linear nature before entering North Central Kansas a few hours later. This was a fairly weakly-forced event in the mid-upper levels, with northern Kansas positioned along the southern periphery of broad westerly flow, and no significant shortwave troughs of note. However, the origins of this early-evening convection could be traced to low-level convergence along a west-east oriented, quasi-stationary surface front draped across south central Nebraska.

The culprits were two separate linear mesoscale convective systems (MCS), with the first one by far the most impactful. This first storm complex, which traversed the area between 10:30 p.m. and 3 a.m. CDT, produced a swath of damaging winds ranging anywhere from 60 up to around 90 MPH, particularly within a corridor centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from Cambridge-Minden-Hastings-Sutton. Within this area, there were countless reports of damage, particularly to the likes of trees (many large trees uprooted), power poles/lines and irrigation pivots, but also to some structures (mainly rural outbuildings). A short list of some of the hardest-hit communities included: Arapahoe, Oxford, Kenesaw and Hastings, with Hastings likely enduring its most widespread tree damage in roughly five years. As just a few specific instances of damage and/or measured winds: a grain bin and outbuilding were destroyed near Holbrook with irrigation pipe blown up to one-half mile; an unofficial mesonet gusted to 95 MPH near Oxford; several farm outbuildings were damaged/destroyed near Phillips with sheet metal hanging in trees. Within the Tri Cities, Hastings clearly bore the brunt of wind issues, as Grand Island and Kearney only received a glancing blow of sub-severe gusts mainly in the 40-55 MPH range. However, some places outside of the main damage swath still weren't spared from storm impacts, including in Farwell, where a lightning-induced fire damaged a portion of the fire hall. This primary linear MCS exhibited impressive radar signatures including a bookend vortex and rear inflow notch, with the system as a whole taking on a notable S-shape on reflectivity. As the initial MCS began departing the local area into eastern Nebraska, a second round of storms got underway back to the west, in response to lift above the residual cold pool. Although not nearly as intense/organized as the earlier system, this convection congealed into a northeast-southwest oriented MCS as it entered southwestern counties such as Furnas/Gosper/Harlan between 3:30-4:30 a.m. CDT. For a while, this second system remained slightly sub-severe, with peak gusts only to around 50 MPH (including 53 MPH at Hastings airport). However, some intensification to marginally-severe levels occurred between 5:30-6:30 a.m. CDT in far southeast counties, evidenced by mesonet wind gusts of 67 MPH near Superior and 60 MPH at Davenport. The back edge of this second MCS departed the local area out of Thayer County by 7 a.m. CDT, finally ending the rocky night. ||Interestingly, severe-criteria hail was very limited during this event, taking a clear backseat to damaging winds. However, a few quarter size stones were reported in and near communities such as Cambridge and Nelson. The Cambridge area was likely the hardest-hit, as copious amounts of mainly small hail combined with winds to promote fairly extensive crop damage. Rainfall-wise, the majority of South Central Nebraska measured between 0.50-1.50, holding flooding issues at bay. However, there were limited corridors of 2-3+, particularly within parts of Furnas/Gosper/Phelps counties. Including more rain that fell on the morning of the 22nd, Thayer County actually dealt with some of the worst flooding issues in the ensuing few days, such as water over several rural roads and a bridge washout north of Chester. ||Looking at the meteorological setup, this was a fairly classic recipe for intense overnight convection in the Central Plains. In the mid-upper levels, seasonably-strong, west-southwesterly flow was in place, downstream from a large-scale trough centered over the Northern Rockies. At the surface, South Central Nebraska resided just north of a west-east oriented front stretched near the Kansas border. As a low-amplitude disturbance entered southern Nebraska during the evening, this forcing combined with a very unstable airmass and increasing moisture convergence within the exit region of a 30-40 knot southerly low level jet to spark the MCS activity. By late-night standards, it was a fairly volatile mesoscale environment, featuring 2000-4000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and 30-40 knots of deep-layer wind shear.","Wind gusts were estimated to be at least 65 MPH across the area.

Widely scattered thunderstorms began forming around 1 PM CST along and west of Highway 183. By 2 PM CST, a persistent line segment of thunderstorms began affecting western Dawson county. Over the following four hours, this southwest-northeast oriented line slowly crept east across Dawson county into western Buffalo county, with its southwest end moving from Gosper county into Phelps county. A downburst occurred in Cozad where winds were measured at 63 mph. Further east, trees were damaged near Elm Creek. This line of storms subsequently weakened as it moved into eastern Buffalo county. However, between 5 and 9 PM CST, numerous small thunderstorms formed over Gosper, Furnas, Phelps, and Harlan counties. Storms kept forming over these counties until a multi-county area of persistent heavy rain enveloped these counties and expanded north to include Dawson and Buffalo counties. By 9 PM CST, the heaviest rain had morphed to the southeast side of a large, expanding rain shield, with a nearly stationary band stretching from southwest to northeast across Furnas, Phelps, and Buffalo counties. After 10 PM CST, a large squall line that had developed far to the west, over the high plains, began moving into south-central Nebraska. It brought a third period of heavy rain to these counties, but its cold pool aided in shoving the training, slow-moving mass of heavy rain eastward. The two areas of rain merged with a progressive squall line subsequently advancing across the rest of the south central Nebraska. The squall line exited into southeast Nebraska by 230 AM CST. Severe downburst winds occurred a few spots with this squall line. A few tree limbs were snapped off in Oxford and Kearney, and 36 power poles were snapped off over a 2-mile stretch southeast of Holdrege. The highest rainfall total reported was 10.65 inches 3 miles southwest of Odessa. The second highest was 8.88 inches in Loomis. 8.33 fell near Hildreth, 7.66 in Riverdale, 7.60 near Lexington, 6.50 near Cozad, 5.90 near Minden, and 5.64 on the southwest side of Kearney.||Late in the afternoon, a few thunderstorms moved north from Kansas ahead of the storms west of Highway 183. These storms produced some spotty tree damage in Webster and Kearney counties, and damage two livestock sheds in the town of Ayr. A brief rope tornado was also reported near Roseland. ||At the surface, a stalled front extended from the Mid-Atlantic states west to the southern Kansas border. Throughout the day, this front gradually lifted north as a warm front. Meanwhile, low pressure over eastern Colorado moved into northwest Kansas, joining the western end of the front. In the upper-levels weak southwest flow was over Nebraska with a longwave trough advancing eastward through the western U.S., and a ridge over the Upper Midwest. An embedded shortwave trough moved out of Colorado and crossed Nebraska, creating a favorable environment for thunderstorms. As the initial thunderstorms developed, the environment was characterized by surface temperatures in the lower to middle 80s, with dewpoints in the lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, but despite that, MLCAPE was 2500-3000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was weak at less than 20 kt. Precipitable water values were around 1.70 inches, which was close to a record. ||The excessive rainfall resulted in flash flooding in parts of Dawson, Gosper, Furnas, Harlan, Phelps, and Buffalo counties, including flooding across parts of U.S. Highways 6, 30, 183, and 283. Numerous gravel county roads were inundated by flood waters and impassible. Many of them were severely damaged. Roads in the city of Kearney were flooded from one curb to the other, and in at least two separate places, water was 3 to 4 ft deep. Almost 40 vehicles were stranded in Kearney streets. Basements were flooded in some homes due to egress windows breaking. The student union was flooded on the University of Nebraska campus in Kearney. Two to three feet of water was reported in the lower level of the food court. In Lexington, cars were stalled in flood waters and 23 people were evacuated from an apartment building due to flooding. The Red Cross opened a shelter to care for those evacuated.||In some areas, the impacts worsened the following day as creeks swelled out of their banks. Gibbon, Kearney, Odessa, Elm Creek, and Lexington were all severely impacted. U.S. highway 30 was closed due to floodwater from Shelton to Kearney to Elm Creek, as well as near Lexington. Turkey Creek drains into the North Channel of the Platte River, which runs through the south side of Kearney. Water rapidly rose on the south side of the city Tuesday morning, inundating numerous hotels, restaurants, businesses, and basements. At least 200 people had to be evacuated from hotels using construction grade front-end loaders. Approximately 100 other nearby residents needed to be evacuated as well. At its peak, water was 2 to 4 feet high inside the hotels, and 4 to 5 feet high in the parking lots. The water rose so quickly that many people staying at the hotels did not have time to move their vehicles. Most vehicles at the hotels were a total loss. Hundreds of vehicles in the city had to be towed. Some businesses were closed for weeks, others for months, as repairs and remodeling were completed. Kitchen equipment was ruined at some restaurants. Of the 1800 hotels rooms in Kearney, only about 600 were available for use because first floor services, such as check-in desks, laundry facilities, and kitchens were damaged. Stagecoach souvenir shop lost 2,000 pounds of merchandise. Second avenue, which is the main north-south thoroughfare through the city, was closed from Interstate 80 to 11th avenue. The Interstate 80 off ramp was also closed. All traffic to and from the Interstate, from the city, had to use the Kearney East Expressway. Approximately 400 Kearney homes were damaged by the flood, and many more beyond city limits. Just as one example, an egress window gave way in a home on the southeast side of Kearney. Water rushed into the basement, filling it nearly to the ceiling. Extensive flooding resulted in the closure of Yanney Park. A power substation flooded and resulted in power outages to about 450 customers. Flood waters began to subside Wednesday, July 10th, which allowed for one lane of 2nd avenue to be reopened in each direction.||In Odessa, flooding was significant. Water was 4 feet deep on Webb street. A little further south, the Odessa exit from Interstate 80 was closed because of significant flooding. Water was about 3 feet deep at the truck stop adjacent to the Interstate. Semi trucks and cars pulled into the truck stop due to the heavy rain Monday evening, but by 630 AM CST Tuesday, water was up to the top of the wheel wells on several semi's. Flooded vehicles had to be towed. The Platte River, which is very wide and shallow, rose 3 feet in 12 hours from 6 PM CST Monday to 6 AM CST Tuesday, and 4 feet in 24 hours. It is very difficult for the Platte River to flood, but it crested at 8.3 feet at 515 PM CST Tuesday. Flood stage is 7 feet.||In the town of Elm Creek, many roads and basements were flooded. A gauge on Elm Creek indicated that the water level rose 8 feet in 2 hours Monday evening.||The city of Lexington issued a disaster declaration due to the disruption of utility services. Streets and homes were flooded with sewers backing up into homes. ||Flooding was extensive along the Wood River. Moderate flooding occurred at Riverdale with water covering the bridge just north of town. Further to the north, flooding forced the closure of state highway 10 between Pleasanton and Hazard.||In Gibbon, water flooded streets and basements for the second time this year. The northeast side of town was impacted the worst with at least 30 homes and several businesses inundated by floodwater. People had to sandbag their homes and businesses. It is believed that flooding on the Wood River was wider with this event, due to changes in the riverbed from the prior flood in March. Some places that did not flood in that event, flooded this time. Many people commented, I can't believe this has happened twice. Several businesses affected by the March flood still remained closed due to damage.||Amtrak trains that travel between Chicago and Emeryville, CA were halted in Lincoln and McCook due to the flooding. There were probably many more impacts that were not documented here as it is not possible to include everything. Widespread flooding of low-lying areas, creeks, and rivers continued for several days following the excessive rain. Flood waters did not recede in some locations until Monday, July 15th. This devastating flood occurred just four months after a catastrophic flood occurred nearby in mid-to-late March.

However, there were a couple of significant exceptions, as heavy rains caused extensive flooding in parts of Valley County and a lone severe storm with damaging winds and large hail brushed far western portions of Dawson and Furnas counties. Going into more detail, and starting with the Valley County situation, a small-but-persistent cluster of heavy showers/non-severe storms dumped a roughly 5-10 mile wide swath of heavy rain on northwestern and south central portions of the county, mainly between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. CDT. These areas received a widespread 2-4 with isolated pockets as high as 5-7, including an unofficial public report of 6.25 nine miles west-southwest of Elyria. Within a few hours after the onset of heavy rain, several rural roads were flooded/washed out, and small creeks such as Turtle Creek spilled out of their banks. An NeRAIN observer southwest of Elyria commented that Turtle Creek flooding was worse than what occurred during the historic March 2019 floods. By the evening and overnight hours, flooding also ramped up on Mira Creek south of Ord, including a bridge washout on a paved county road. During the pre-dawn hours of the 3rd, Mira Creek flooding reached the town of North Loup, prompting mainly minor water issues on the north side of town. Turning to the severe storm aspect of the day (and completely separate from the Valley County flooding), an isolated severe storm tracked almost due south over the western fringes of Dawson and Furnas counties between 6:30-9:30 p.m. CDT, affecting the Gothenburg and Cambridge areas. Near Gothenburg, a mesonet clocked a 66 MPH gust and a flag pole was bent over. A bit later, trained spotters just west of Cambridge reported hail up to golf ball size and a measured wind gust of 71 MPH, with a few power poles downed on Highway 6/34.||In the big picture of the mid-upper levels, forcing was nebulous over the Central Plains as subtle waves passed through northwesterly flow, directed around the edge of an expansive ridge centered over New Mexico. Most notably for the Valley County flooding, precipitable water values averaged nearly 2, fostering impressive rainfall rates in low-topped cells. For the evening severe storm in Dawson/Furnas counties, mesoscale parameters featured around 1500 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 35 knots of deep-layer wind shear. At the surface, a nondescript pattern existed over South Central Nebraska, with light southerly-to-easterly breezes and dewpoints in the upper 60s to around 70 F.","A 71 MPH wind gust was measured by a mesonet station located 1 mile west-northwest of Cambridge.

The culprits were two separate linear mesoscale convective systems (MCS), with the first one by far the most impactful. This first storm complex, which traversed the area between 10:30 p.m. and 3 a.m. CDT, produced a swath of damaging winds ranging anywhere from 60 up to around 90 MPH, particularly within a corridor centered roughly 15 miles either side of a line from Cambridge-Minden-Hastings-Sutton. Within this area, there were countless reports of damage, particularly to the likes of trees (many large trees uprooted), power poles/lines and irrigation pivots, but also to some structures (mainly rural outbuildings). A short list of some of the hardest-hit communities included: Arapahoe, Oxford, Kenesaw and Hastings, with Hastings likely enduring its most widespread tree damage in roughly five years. As just a few specific instances of damage and/or measured winds: a grain bin and outbuilding were destroyed near Holbrook with irrigation pipe blown up to one-half mile; an unofficial mesonet gusted to 95 MPH near Oxford; several farm outbuildings were damaged/destroyed near Phillips with sheet metal hanging in trees. Within the Tri Cities, Hastings clearly bore the brunt of wind issues, as Grand Island and Kearney only received a glancing blow of sub-severe gusts mainly in the 40-55 MPH range. However, some places outside of the main damage swath still weren't spared from storm impacts, including in Farwell, where a lightning-induced fire damaged a portion of the fire hall. This primary linear MCS exhibited impressive radar signatures including a bookend vortex and rear inflow notch, with the system as a whole taking on a notable S-shape on reflectivity. As the initial MCS began departing the local area into eastern Nebraska, a second round of storms got underway back to the west, in response to lift above the residual cold pool. Although not nearly as intense/organized as the earlier system, this convection congealed into a northeast-southwest oriented MCS as it entered southwestern counties such as Furnas/Gosper/Harlan between 3:30-4:30 a.m. CDT. For a while, this second system remained slightly sub-severe, with peak gusts only to around 50 MPH (including 53 MPH at Hastings airport). However, some intensification to marginally-severe levels occurred between 5:30-6:30 a.m. CDT in far southeast counties, evidenced by mesonet wind gusts of 67 MPH near Superior and 60 MPH at Davenport. The back edge of this second MCS departed the local area out of Thayer County by 7 a.m. CDT, finally ending the rocky night. ||Interestingly, severe-criteria hail was very limited during this event, taking a clear backseat to damaging winds. However, a few quarter size stones were reported in and near communities such as Cambridge and Nelson. The Cambridge area was likely the hardest-hit, as copious amounts of mainly small hail combined with winds to promote fairly extensive crop damage. Rainfall-wise, the majority of South Central Nebraska measured between 0.50-1.50, holding flooding issues at bay. However, there were limited corridors of 2-3+, particularly within parts of Furnas/Gosper/Phelps counties. Including more rain that fell on the morning of the 22nd, Thayer County actually dealt with some of the worst flooding issues in the ensuing few days, such as water over several rural roads and a bridge washout north of Chester. ||Looking at the meteorological setup, this was a fairly classic recipe for intense overnight convection in the Central Plains. In the mid-upper levels, seasonably-strong, west-southwesterly flow was in place, downstream from a large-scale trough centered over the Northern Rockies. At the surface, South Central Nebraska resided just north of a west-east oriented front stretched near the Kansas border. As a low-amplitude disturbance entered southern Nebraska during the evening, this forcing combined with a very unstable airmass and increasing moisture convergence within the exit region of a 30-40 knot southerly low level jet to spark the MCS activity. By late-night standards, it was a fairly volatile mesoscale environment, featuring 2000-4000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE and 30-40 knots of deep-layer wind shear.",A wind gust of 70 MPH was measured by a mesonet station located 4 miles east of Ragan.,CSV

Unfortunately, what transpired on this Thursday evening the 22nd into early Friday morning the 23rd fell into the low-predictability category, as an apparent mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) sparked isolated-but-intense thunderstorms that not only dumped flooding rains on parts of Sherman/Buffalo/Howard/Hall/Adams counties, but also brought a damaging combination of winds and hail to parts of Hall/Adams counties. Going into more detail, and starting with the severe weather aspect, around 1:30 a.m. CDT a severe thunderstorm rapidly blossomed over southern Hall County. It started drifting slowly south-southeast, reaching Hastings around 3 a.m. CDT and eventually weakening/dissipating over southern Clay County between 4-5 a.m. CDT. Along the way, this storm produced winds measured as high as 76 MPH at Hastings airport, along  with copious amounts of hail up to half dollar size. In Hall County, at least one semi truck was blown over on Interstate 80. However, Hastings was the hardest hit local community, specifically the west side of town and adjacent rural areas, where the wind/hail combo shredded trees and gardens, damaged house siding and ravaged maturing crops. Some hail drifts in/near west Hastings were still visible well into the daytime hours (side note: this was at least the third time in 2019 that severe storms impacted Hastings). Flooding was certainly an issue within Hall/Adams counties as well, particularly in the Amick Acres neighborhood west of Doniphan where a CoCoRaHS observer measured 4.54 of rain. This prompted extensive flooding of basements and overflowed a series of small lakes (at least minor flooding would continue at Amick Acres for several more days). Flooding was less-severe in the Hastings area, but there was still short-term flooding of fields and rural roads (including the brief closure of Showboat Road just east of town). ||Although the weather impacts in Hall/Adams counties dominated the local news headlines, significant-but-localized flooding also occurred in more rural areas of southern Sherman, northeastern Buffalo and southeastern Howard counties earlier in the night. Focusing on the more significant event in Sherman/Buffalo counties, a slow-moving series of re-generating storms dumped 2-5+ inches of rain along a narrow corridor from south of Loup City to south of Ravenna, with the majority falling between 7 p.m. and midnight CDT. There were a few unofficial public reports of totals as high as 7-7.50, along with some ground-truth reports of flooding/flash flooding, including water running over portions of Highways 10 and 68. As mentioned at the top, the development and intensity of these evening and overnight storms was not well-anticipated in official forecasts, as numerical models failed to latch onto the apparent influence of a pesky, slow-moving MCV that drifted eastward into South Central Nebraska during the day on the 22nd and stuck around through the night. The larger scale mid-upper air pattern over Nebraska was not very notable, featuring only subtle/low amplitude disturbances ejecting eastward from a trough centered over the Northern Rockies. Adding to the surprising intensity of this convection, mesoscale analysis depicted only weak deep-layer wind shear of no more than 25-30 knots, along with only around 1000 J/kg most-unstable CAPE.","A 76 MPH wind gust was measured by the Hastings Airport ASOS at 2:59 AM CDT. Wind gusts were estimated to be near 70 to 75 MPH along this path. A light helicopter was blown over at the Hastings Airport. Quarter to half dollar size hail was also reported near the airport, which combined with intense winds to shred trees, crops and gardens, and damage house siding, in and near the west side of Hastings.",CSV

In southern/western Rooks County, winds of at least 70-75 MPH rolled through 9-10 p.m. CDT, causing at least minor wind damage in several towns including: Plainville, Damar, Palco, Zurich and Codell. In Plainville, intense winds inflicted fairly extensive tree damage and toppled all but the bottom section of a county communications tower. Five miles south of Plainville, a semi truck was blown over. At nearly the same time as the Rooks County action, a completely separate cluster of severe storms rumbled through Jewell County, with limited reports including estimated 60-65 MPH winds at Burr Oak and a large tree downed at the courthouse in Mankato. ||Taking a closer look at storm evolution within the area, and starting with Rooks County, this intense supercell cluster initiated nearly 150 miles northwest of the area (in southwest Nebraska) during the mid-afternoon. After first tracking more southward in Nebraska as an at-times tornadic storm, it made more of an eastward turn over northwest Kansas, becoming increasingly outflow-dominant as it raced through Rooks County on its way into central Kansas. Meanwhile, the severe multicell cluster that impacted Jewell County initiated just north of the state line in far south central Nebraska around 8:30 p.m. CDT before crossing into Kansas. Actually, both the Rooks and Jewell County storm clusters partially-merged together over Osborne/Mitchell counties before completely departing the local area, but those counties yielded no severe weather reports. The entire local area was storm-free by around 11 p.m. CDT. Turning to the meteorological setup, this event had fairly decent forcing by August standards, especially in the lower levels. Aloft, west-northwesterly flow was in place, with a low-amplitude shortwave trough approaching North Central Kansas from the CO/NE/WY border area. At the surface, the main player was a slow-moving, west-east oriented cold front sinking slowly southward from Nebraska into northern Kansas. Along and ahead of this surface boundary the airmass was very unstable, with dewpoints in the low-mid 70s. As storms infiltrated the local area, the mesoscale environment featured a decent combo of 2000-4000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and 35 knots of effective deep-layer wind shear.",A 61 MPH wind gust was measured by a mesonet station located 3 miles west-northwest of Jewell.,CSV

There was a tight thermal gradient along the surface low/warm front across central Minnesota. During the afternoon, dew points rose to near 80 in the warm sector, with 50s/60s north of the front. This contrast produced MLCAPEs of near 5000 J/kg south of the front boundary. Effective wind shear parameters were very strong with values of 50-70 knots across central Minnesota, and into west central Wisconsin by the late afternoon. This environment allowed for supercells to form which congealed into a bow echo that raced across east central Minnesota, and into west central Wisconsin. Very large hail, damaging straight-line winds, and a few tornadoes occurred with this bow echo. ||There was almost a continuous swath of large hail, measured up to golf ball size, that  fell from Stevens County, northeast through Pope, Douglas, and Todd Counties before 1230 CST. Damage occurred to cars, windows, and crops along the storm's path. Another severe storm developed west of Todd County, and moved across northern Todd County, and into Morrison County. There were numerous reports of large hail once again with the largest report of baseball size hail near Cushing. There were also reports of trees and power lines down across central and southwest Morrison County. ||Most of the damage in Mille Lacs, and Kanabec Counties was associated with straight line winds, but there were a couple reports of large hail. The bow echo intensified as it moved across Kanabec County, into southern Pine and northern Chisago Counties. ||The worst damage occurred from near Rush City, southeast into west central Wisconsin. The Chisago County fair had to be closed due to trees and power lines that were blown down throughout the fair grounds.","The bow echo that moved across Pine County, continued to intensify.

Quite simply, this was a nasty wind storm, packing a punch with gusts ranging from around 60 to nearly 90 MPH along and several miles either side of a line stretching from Ord-Grand Island-Hastings-Hardy. For the city of Grand Island, this was likely the overall-worst wind storm in several years, as the airport ASOS clocked a peak gust of 87 MPH. Countless trees/large branches were blown down within the city, along with several power lines, and there was also some (mainly) minor structural damage. Grand Island Emergency Center logged nearly 300 storm related incidents, including traffic hazards, power outages, alarms and fire concerns from sparking electricity. The storm also caused an (indirect) traffic fatality in rural Hall County southeast of Cairo, when a man crashed his pickup into a large, downed tree arched across a paved county road. To the south in Hastings, damage was less-severe overall, as the ASOS peak gust on the west side of town was only 70 MPH. However, stronger winds likely impacted areas just east of the city, as large trees were uprooted at Central Community College and several rail cars were reportedly blown over at a repair facility near the Clay County line. Several smaller communities also reported notable wind damage, including: Cairo, Alda, Wood River, Doniphan, Glenvil, and Fairfield. West of Clay Center, fairly extensive damage occurred on the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center campus, including broken windows and roof damage to several buildings. In addition to the aforementioned peak wind gusts at Grand Island/Hastings airports, some of the more notable unofficial (mesonet) gusts included: 85 MPH near Fairfield, 80 MPH near Alda and Wood River, 79 MPH in Doniphan and 73 MPH near Nelson. Despite the multitude of damaging wind reports, hail reports were quite scarce, as the vast majority of stones were likely dime size or smaller. Rainfall-wise, a fairly widespread coverage of 2-3 soaked several northern counties including: Valley, Greeley, Sherman, Nance and Merrick. Although resultant flooding was not very extensive in most of the area, the Mira Creek in southern Valley County breached its banks for the second time in five days, again prompting minor flooding on the north side of North Loup that continued into the early morning of the 8th.||Breaking down the timing and meteorological background of this event, it's worth noting that these South Central Nebraska damaging winds were actually the finale to a much longer swath of severe weather that initiated in southern ND and north central SD during the afternoon/evening of the 6th. Between 1-2 a.m. CDT on the 7th, the leading edge of this narrow-but-potent mesoscale convective system (MCS) entered far northern portions of the local area into Valley/Greeley counties, signaling its arrival with a 59 MPH gust at Ord airport. However, the worst was yet to come, as during the next few hours the storm complex morphed into more of an outflow-dominant, high-precipitation supercell, slamming through the Grand Island/Hastings areas between 2:30-3:30 a.m. CDT before eventually exiting Nuckolls/Thayer counties into Kansas by 5 a.m. CDT. In the wake of the main show, a few weaker clusters of storms redeveloped over parts of the area into the daylight hours, but were of little significance. In the big picture of the mid-upper levels, this event occurred within a fairly classic summertime northwest-flow regime, as the Central Plains resided northeast of an expansive ridge centered over New Mexico. At the surface, South Central Nebraska was on the backside of a weak ridge axis centered near the Nebraska-Iowa border. This promoted light-but-steady, south-southeast breezes in advance of the approaching storm complex, with surface dewpoints averaging mid-upper 60s F. Although there were question marks about how far southward into Nebraska the potential severe weather threat would extend, the combination of seasonably-stout flow aloft (deep-layer wind shear of at least 40-60 knots) and sufficient instability (mixed-layer CAPE of 1000-2000 J/kg) was clearly supportive of an intense late-night storm. Also enhancing the severe weather environment was a modest, 30 knot  southwesterly low level jet (evident at 850 millibars) and its associated low-level warm air/moisture advection.",Wind gusts estimated to be near 70 MPH resulted in widespread tree damage in Oak.,CSV

Things started out with a smattering of large hail reports before transitioning to mainly a heavy rain and relatively minor flash flooding event, particularly within western Nuckolls and far eastern Webster counties where rain totals of 2-4 inches were common, and highlighted by 4.72 per an unofficial mesonet west-southwest of Nelson. As for hail, the largest reported stones up to golf ball size occurred in McCool Junction and southeast of Sutton. Severe-criteria wind reports were quite limited, but a mesonet southwest of Nelson gusted to 64 MPH and a completely separate batch of storms farther west yielded a 63 MPH mesonet gust near Cambridge. The most impactful flooding report involved a multiple-hour closure of Highway 136 in far western Nuckolls County due to water over the road. In addition, runoff from heavy rain promoted minor flooding along the Republican River in southern Nuckolls County, with the automated gauge near Hardy cresting at 11.66 ft. during the very early morning hours of Sunday the 16th (flood stage 11.0 ft.).||Breaking down event evolution, severe storms initially got underway between 8-10 p.m. CDT as a cluster of semi-discrete cells erupted within Clay, Fillmore and southern York counties, yielding the majority of the evening's hail reports. Then between 10 p.m. and midnight CDT and slightly to the southwest of the initial storms, additional severe convection and flooding rains blossomed over Nuckolls and eastern Webster counties. After midnight, the most intense storms gradually weakened and/or slipped south of the state line into Kansas, although weaker activity lingered a few more hours before ending altogether. Completely separate from (and several counties to the west of) the severe convection in southeastern counties, a small cluster of storms entered Furnas County from the west shortly before midnight CDT, generating the aforementioned severe gust near Cambridge before quickly weakening. Turning to the meteorological setup, a broad quasi-zonal flow regime was present in the mid-upper levels, featuring passing low-amplitude disturbances. At the surface, the initial evening development seemed to concentrate along a subtle, west-east front, in a mesoscale environment featuring a relatively potent combination of 2000-3000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE and around 30 knots of deep-layer wind shear. In addition, convection was aided by warm air/moisture advection along the northwestern fringes of a nocturnal low level jet primarily aligned from southern Kansas into Missouri.",A 64 mph wind gust was measured by a mesonet station located 6 miles southwest of Nelson.,CSV
